 <main class="introduction">

    <br>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Mauricio. My professional journey began in the Spring of 2019 working for one of the largest social media companies in the world. Little did I know at the time, but this role would open my mind to a whole new world beyond my imagination.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="tldr">tldr;</p>

            <p class="firstjob"><em>My first tech role involved many of the fundamental tasks of information security. That being: securing client confidentiality (PII), identifying operational security risks, deploying key initiatives to combat malicious bad actors, and working to scale automation solutions through data labeling and a bit of software testing.</em></p>

            <p>As the world continues to become ever more connected, the rise is cybercrime continues to develop as well. According to Forbes, it is estimated that-cyber attacks have accounted for an estimate of $400 billion in damages yearly â€“ $100 billion in the U.S. alone. It is inherently important for any individual to learn more about information security. Organizations and institutions can only do so much on their end to protect consumers and their products from potential bad actors. However, we also have to do our own due diligence along the way.</p>
            <p>A few hobbies of mine include fitness, photography, and reading up on the latest gaming trends! My all-time favorite game is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time ever since I first played  15 years ago on the Nintendo 64. An honorable mention to Metroid Zero Mission on the Gameboy Advance as well! I've played it more times than I can remember, but it is just a masterpiece.
            <p>I am a bit of a watch enthusiast. If I'm being completely honest... I have one too many actually. A goal of mine is to someday create a YouTube channel where I can document my experience and watch collecting journey with the rest of the watch community. </p>
